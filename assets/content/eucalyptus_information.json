Eucalypts are naturally found only in New Guinea, Philipines and couple of small islands. Eucalyptus trees are also known as gum trees because they put out lots of sap from any break in the bark. Eucalyptus trees have many local names, like 'gum trees', 'mallee', 'box', 'ironbark', 'stringybark' and 'ash'. Eucalyptus trees can grow upto 33 meters in height. Famously, these trees are home to some animals like koalas in Australia. The diet of koalas consists almost solely of eucalyptus leaves!
